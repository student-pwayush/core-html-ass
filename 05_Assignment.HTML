    <dl>
        <dt>Front-end</dt>
        <dd>
            The front-end is the user interface of a web application that users interact with directly. It includes technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and interactive web pages.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</dt>
        <dd>
            HTML is used for structuring the content of web pages, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</dt>
        <dd>
            CSS is used for styling web pages, controlling the layout, fonts, colors, and overall appearance of the user interface.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>
            JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to web pages, allowing for dynamic content, form validation, and more.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Back-end</dt>
        <dd>
            The back-end is responsible for server-side logic, database management, and communication with the front-end. Common technologies include server-side languages, databases, and frameworks.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Node.js</dt>
        <dd>
            Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and efficient server-side applications.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Express.js</dt>
        <dd>
            Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the creation of APIs and routing in server-side applications.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)</dt>
        <dd>
            Databases store and manage data for web applications. Different types of databases, like SQL or NoSQL, are used based on project requirements.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Back-end Frameworks (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Django, Laravel)</dt>
        <dd>
            Back-end frameworks provide tools and structure for building robust web applications with features like authentication, routing, and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
        </dd>
        
        <dt>API (Application Programming Interface)</dt>
        <dd>
            APIs allow different software components to communicate and exchange data. RESTful or GraphQL APIs are common in web development.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Version Control (e.g., Git)</dt>
        <dd>
            Version control systems like Git are used to track changes in code, collaborate with team members, and manage code repositories.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Deployment and Hosting (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Netlify)</dt>
        <dd>
            Deployment platforms and hosting services allow web applications to be made accessible to users on the internet.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>DevOps (Development and Operations)</dt>
        <dd>
            DevOps practices involve the automation of development, testing, and deployment processes to enhance collaboration and code quality.
        </dd>
